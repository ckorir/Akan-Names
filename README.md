# Akan Names
The website was reated by Chris Ruto.</br>
This is a web page that allows you to find out your Akan name depending on the day you were born.</br>
The website allows the user to input details on the day, month, year and the century they were born.
It then uses this information to calculate the exact day of the week the person was born and gives the user their akan name.<br>
The languages used to program this website were:
<li>Html</br>
<li>Css</br>
<li>Java Script</br>
